In the field of autonomous navigation, perception of
the driving scene is one of the essential elements. Existing solutions combine on-board exteroceptive sensors, and are capable of
understanding some of the near vehicle’s dynamic surrounding
environment. Furthermore, the perception capability of each
vehicle can be enhanced by wireless information sharing if
vehicles in the neighborhood transmit pertinent information.
The primary benefit of such approach is to enable and improve
the performance–safety of cooperative autonomous driving. The
introduction of such a vehicle-to-vehicle communication leads to
think of the global architecture as a system of systems. In this
work, we address the task of evidential occupancy grid fusion so
that a given vehicle can refine and complete its occupancy grid
with the help of grids received from other near vehicles. The
communication channel is supposed to be ideal, noiseless with
infinite capacity. We focus on the fusion framework itself, using
the theory of belief functions for reasoning with uncertainties on
the relative poses of the vehicles and on the exchanged sensor
measurement data. We evaluate the fusion system with real data
acquired on public roads, with two connected vehicles.
