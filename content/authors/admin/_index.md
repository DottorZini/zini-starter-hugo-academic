Since 2016, I work and research for making vehicles smarter and safer. Today, I design, implement and validate algorithms for road scene understanding in ADAS software of Renault vehicles. I obtained a PhD in Automation and Robotics from Université de Technologie de Compiègne in partnership with Renault Group.
